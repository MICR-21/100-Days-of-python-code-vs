# **100 Days of Python - Project-Based Learning** 🐍🔥

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python** journey! This course is designed to help me build a strong foundation in Python through **hands-on projects** every day.  

## **📌 Course Overview**
This challenge follows a structured roadmap where I learn and apply Python concepts through **daily coding exercises and projects**. Each day builds upon the previous one, covering everything from **basic syntax** to **advanced applications** like **web development, automation, data science, and more**.  

## **🎯 Goals**
- Master Python from beginner to advanced level.  
- Work on **real-world projects** to apply concepts.  
- Improve problem-solving skills and coding efficiency.  
- Develop a **portfolio** of Python projects.  
- Stay consistent and disciplined for 100 days!  

## **📂 Course Structure**
Each day includes:  
- **A new Python concept** (e.g., loops, OOP, APIs).  
- **A coding exercise** to reinforce learning.  
- **A small or full-fledged project** to apply skills.  

## **🚀 Projects List (Some Highlights)**
Here are some projects I'll be working on:  
✔ **Day 1-10:** Beginner Projects (e.g., Calculator, Password Generator, hangman, blackjack)  
✔ **Day 11-30:** Intermediate Projects (e.g., Web Scraper, To-Do App)  
✔ **Day 31-60:** Advanced Projects (e.g., GUI Apps, APIs, Databases)  
✔ **Day 61-100:** Expert-Level Projects (e.g., AI, Automation, Web Dev, Data Science)  

## **📜 Progress & Documentation**
I’ll be documenting my progress, challenges, and lessons learned each day. All code and projects will be available in this repository.  

## **💡 Technologies Used**
- **Python 3**  
- Libraries like **Pandas, Flask, Tkinter, BeautifulSoup, Requests, etc.**  
- APIs for real-world data  
- Web frameworks and automation tools  

## **🎯 Final Goal**
By the end of 100 days, I will have **a solid grasp of Python** and a **portfolio of projects** to showcase my skills.
